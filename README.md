# Javascript Function with Zero Input Bug

This repository demonstrates a common yet easily overlooked bug in JavaScript functions involving zero inputs. The `myFunction` initially lacks robust handling of zero values, leading to unexpected or incorrect outputs. The corrected version efficiently addresses this issue, ensuring the function behaves as intended in all cases, including scenarios with zero inputs.

## Bug Description

The original function `myFunction` fails to correctly handle cases where either input `a` or `b` is zero.  This could lead to unexpected results like division by zero errors or incorrect calculations.  The fix provides a proper and safe way to handle these edge cases.

## Solution

The solution involves explicitly checking for zero inputs (`a === 0 || b === 0`) and returning an appropriate value (0 in this case) or handling the case in a more appropriate manner to prevent errors. This prevents unexpected behavior when dealing with zero values.
